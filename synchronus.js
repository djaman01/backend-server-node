var fs = require("fs");
//Here, you are importing the built-in 'fs' module in Node.js, which stands for "file system." This module provides functions for working with the file system, including reading and writing files.

var data = fs.readFileSync('input.txt');
//This line of code reads the contents of the file named "input.txt" synchronously, meaning it will block the execution of any further code until the file is completely read. The readFileSync function returns the file's contents as a Buffer object, which is then assigned to the variable data.

console.log(data.toString());
//Here, you convert the data from a Buffer object to a string using the toString() method. This is necessary because the file contents are read as binary data by default, and you typically want to work with them as text. Then, you use console.log to print the contents of the file to the console.
console.log("Program Ended");
//Finally, this line of code prints the string "Program Ended" to the console. This message is displayed after the file contents have been printed.

//In summary, this code reads the contents of "input.txt" synchronously, converts the data to a string, and then prints both the file's contents and "Program Ended" to the console. It's important to note that using readFileSync for file I/O operations can block the program's execution, making it less efficient, especially for large files or in situations where you want to perform other tasks concurrently. Asynchronous file reading with callbacks or promises is often recommended for better performance and responsiveness in real-world applications.
