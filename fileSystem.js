//This code is a simple Node.js program that reads the contents of a file named "input.txt" using both asynchronous and synchronous methods and then prints the contents to the console

// This line imports the Node.js built-in "fs" module, which provides functions for working with the file system.
var fs = require("fs");

// Asynchronous read
//This part of the code reads the file "input.txt" asynchronously. It uses a callback function to handle the result of the file read operation.
fs.readFile('input.txt', function (err, data) {
   if (err) {
      return console.error(err);
   }
   console.log("Asynchronous read: " + data.toString());
});

// Synchronous read
//This part of the code reads the file "input.txt" synchronously using fs.readFileSync().
//Unlike the asynchronous method, this operation blocks the program's execution until the file is fully read.
var data = fs.readFileSync('input.txt');
console.log("Synchronous read: " + data.toString());

//This line simply prints "Program Ended" to the console after both the asynchronous and synchronous file read operations are initiated.
console.log("Program Ended");

//In summary, the purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to read the contents of a file using both asynchronous and synchronous methods in Node.js, and it displays the contents along with appropriate messages to the console. The asynchronous method allows the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the file read to complete, while the synchronous method blocks the program until the file read is finished.
